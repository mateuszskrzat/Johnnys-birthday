# Johnnys-birthday
Problem with Johnny's birthday solved by my formula

        PROBLEM:
        When it's Johnny's birthday, he always gets a cake with candles which are all numbered and placed in an ascending
        order around a circle.
        Johnny blows the candles out starting from the first one and blowing out every second candle which is still lit
        (so that the first blown out candle on the cake is the one with number 2).
        He continues to do so until there is only one lit candle left on the cake. Before this ritual,
        Johnny always wonders which candle will he blow out as the last.
        Help Johnny determine the answer, knowing which birthday he is celebrating.
